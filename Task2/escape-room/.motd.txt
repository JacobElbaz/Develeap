Welcome to the Bash Escape Room!
================================
In the following excercise you are requested to move from room to room, starting with `room1/`.

From `room2` and above the rooms are locked with codes. To get these codes you will have to solve the previous rooms.

In each room the README file will guide you, sometimes it will be clear, but sometimes you will be required to think and research your way to the solution.

To pass the code to the locked rooms open the README file using 'vi' or 'vim'.

Good Luck!

The develeap education team.
